I created a Java class (Book class) that represents the chosen entity with various attributes and methods. And also created a UML Class Diagram to visualize the structure of my class, Which you can see in the README file. In my class there are 4 attributes that represent the key characteristics of the entity (title, author, ISBN, price). I used a parameterized constructor to initialize all the attributes. Created an additional method that performs a meaningful action related to the entity (calculateDiscountPrice). And of course I used the method displayInfo.
